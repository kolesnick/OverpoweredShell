# OverpoweredShell

Did you ever wanted to
```google how to boil an egg```
?

Or maybe you were stuck with too long console output, so you decided to
```Ask-Google how to clear PowerShell console```
?

Now you can do all of that directly from your PowerShell host. The code blocks from above are actual PowerShell commands. Easy-peasy :)
